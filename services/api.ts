/**
 * API Service Layer
 * 
 * DEVELOPMENT MODE:
 * This file is currently configured to use a mock API (`services/mockApi.ts`).
 * This allows for full frontend development and testing without a running backend.
 * All data is stored in-memory and will reset on page refresh.
 * 
 * To switch to the real backend, you would need to replace the content of this file
 * with the functions that make `fetch` calls to your API endpoints.
